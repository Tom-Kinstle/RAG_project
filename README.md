# RAG_project

🏘️ Making HOA Compliance Easier with AI-Powered Search

HOA documents are dense, inconsistent, and hard to search—but compliance questions don’t wait. This project builds a fast, flexible retrieval system that answers common HOA governance questions by scanning bylaws across multiple communities.

What You’ll Learn:
How retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can turn static legal text into a dynamic, searchable resource—improving access, clarity, and response time for HOA boards or property managers.

Highlights:

✅ Real questions tied to California HOA law

📁 Auto-loads and processes public HOA files

🔍 Uses chunking, embeddings, and FAISS to surface relevant answers

📊 Includes scoring to explain answer quality (semantic, vector, lexical)

This proof of concept shows how legal and compliance-heavy organizations can use modern search techniques to reduce manual effort and improve transparency.
