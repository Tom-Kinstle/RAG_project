🏘️ Making HOA Compliance Easier with AI-Powered Search

HOA documents are dense, inconsistent, and time-consuming to read, making manual review a slow and error-prone process. This project delivers a fast, flexible retrieval system that answers common HOA governance questions by semantically scanning bylaws across multiple communities—streamlining compliance checks and reducing the burden on human reviewers.

Highlights:

✅ Real questions tied to California HOA law

📁 Auto-loads and processes public HOA files

🔍 Uses chunking, embeddings, and FAISS to surface relevant answers

📊 Includes scoring to explain answer quality (semantic, vector, lexical)

This proof of concept shows how legal and compliance-heavy organizations can use modern search techniques to reduce manual effort and improve transparency.
