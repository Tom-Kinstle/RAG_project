üèòÔ∏è Making HOA Compliance Easier with AI-Powered Search

HOA documents are dense, inconsistent, and hard to search‚Äîbut compliance questions don‚Äôt wait. This project builds a fast, flexible retrieval system that answers common HOA governance questions by scanning bylaws across multiple communities.

What You‚Äôll Learn:
How retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can turn static legal text into a dynamic, searchable resource‚Äîimproving access, clarity, and response time for HOA boards or property managers.

Highlights:

‚úÖ Real questions tied to California HOA law

üìÅ Auto-loads and processes public HOA files

üîç Uses chunking, embeddings, and FAISS to surface relevant answers

üìä Includes scoring to explain answer quality (semantic, vector, lexical)

This proof of concept shows how legal and compliance-heavy organizations can use modern search techniques to reduce manual effort and improve transparency.
